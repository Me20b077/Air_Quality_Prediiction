# Air Quality Index Prediction
1. The Aim of this project is to predict an air quality indicator called Air Quality Index (AQI).
2. The pollutants such as PM2.5, NO, NH3, Benzene, O3, etc... are features to predict the value of AQI.
3. You can get the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
